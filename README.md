# RDR Script Decompiler
A program that will decompile the script resources (XSC, CSC) files from both X360 and PS3 versions of Red Dead Redemption to High-Level.
SCOs are not supported mainly because they're not used by the game even if they are in the RPF container.

Note that a lot of the code is still broken. It's either OpCodes are messed up or Rockstar was smoking something.
Some scripts contains branches that always ends up at the same place and doesn't do anything and fakes the reading.
Decompiler is based on Zorg93 (NayJames93)'s decompiler made for Grand Theft Auto V.
